<h2 id="what-is-xxc">What is XXC?</h2>
XXC is the name of the reference compiler for the X programming language. <br>
It is the original compiler of the X programming language. <br>
The features that XXC has is a representation of the official and must-have features of the X programming language.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

The X programming language is compiled, static typed, fast, modern and simple.<br>
Before the X source code is compiled, it is translated to C++ code and compiled from C++.<br>
Transpiling to C++ only instead of compiling is also an option.<br>
It aims to be advanced, readable and a good choice for systems programming.

<strong>Example X code;</strong>
```go
main() {
  outln("Hello, GitHub!")
}
```

<h2 id="why-x">Why X?</h2>

<h3>Simplicity</h3>

X is a simple language that anyone can understand. <br>
It is clear, simple and useful for beginners or experts.

<h3>Efficient</h3>

The translation of X to C++ code happens very quickly and efficiently. <br>
In addition, the generated C++ result is human readable, understandable and efficient code.

<h3>Learning</h3>

X is pretty easy to learn. <br>
It's not a compelling option for those new to programming either.

On the other hand, X is also a way to learn algorithms and see the C++ equivalent in an easier way since it is translated into human readable C++ code.
In this way, X can also be used as an easy interface for learning C++.

<h2 id="documentations">Documentations</h2>

All documentation about XXC (naturally X programming language) is on the website. <br>
[See Documentations](https://the-xlang.github.io/website/pages/docs.html)

<h2 id="building-project">Building Project</h2>

> [Website documentation](https://the-xlang.github.io/website/pages/docs.html?page=getting-started-install-from-source) for install from source.

XXC aims to have a single main build file. <br>
XXC is in development with the [Go](https://github.com/golang/go) programming language. <br>
That is until the X programming language matures. <br>
Later, XXC is planned to be developed with the X programming language.

### Building with Go Compiler
```
go build -o xxc -v cmd/xxc/main.go
```
Run the above command in your terminal, in the XXC project directory.
